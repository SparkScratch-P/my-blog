## Turing has been calling me for sometime, almost fallen behind. So, I decided to setup. Here's what I faced in the test!:


## This is a question that was there in the practice for Final Examination for the jobs!!

## Well, so I was said to edit this code, and bring all those parameters in. I chose Javascript:

## What comes to your mind???
## Some sober answers like this, that you would write in the place selected in the above picture...

## Seems too complex for me! 

## It should satisfy this, as given, i must write and run, only one chance..so, high risk of failing!

## I can make it way easy! I just need to make it 'valid' !

## This was the initial line!
